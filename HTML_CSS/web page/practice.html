<p title="Gender facts">Gender discrimination, also known as sexual discrimination, is any action that specifically denies opportunities,</br> privileges, or rewards to a person (or a group) because of gender.</br> The practice of letting a person's gender become a factor when deciding who receives </br> a job or a promotion, is gender discrimination.</p>
<p title="Gender equality">Natural differences exist between the sexes based on biological and anatomic factors, mostly differing reproductive roles.</br> Biological differences include chromosomes and hormonal differences.[1] There is a natural difference also in the relative physical strengths receives </br> (on average) of the sexes, both in the lower body and more pronouncedly in the upper-body, though this does not mean that any given man is stronger than any given woman.[2][3] Men, on average, are taller, which provides both advantages and disadvantages.[4] Women live significantly longer than men,[5] though it is not clear to what extent this is a biological difference - see Life expectancy. Men have larger lung volumes and more circulating blood cells and clotting factors, while women have more circulating white blood cells and produce antibodies faster.[6] Differences such as these are hypothesized to be an adaption allowing for sexual specialization.[7]
